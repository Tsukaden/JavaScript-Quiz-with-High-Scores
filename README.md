This homework assignment involves creating a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that allows coding boot camp students to test their knowledge and store their high scores. The quiz will be presented in the browser and will include features like a timer and the ability to save initials and scores.

## Summary

The JavaScript quiz accomplishes the following:

- When the user clicks the "Start" button, a timer starts, and the user is presented with a question.

By developing this JavaScript quiz, coding boot camp students can test their understanding of JavaScript concepts and gauge their progress compared to their peers. The quiz provides an interactive and engaging way to reinforce learning and improve JavaScript proficiency. Additionally, the ability to save initials and scores allows students to track their performance over time and strive for higher scores.
